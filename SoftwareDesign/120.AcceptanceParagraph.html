On behalf of user's representative, I accepted the design from HappyFunTime tream of creating the Game of Life.

<h2 id="AcceptanceParagraph">Acceptance Paragraph</h2>
<p>
This Software design proposal is an appropriate representation of The Game of LIFE and its elements.
</p>
<p>
The lauch screen captures the sentiment of the game with its oversized logo, however, the fields of first name and last name seems rather formal.<br>
This could easily be subsituted with a username that consists of the player's initials.<br>
The game board design appears minimalistic yet functial, with the current player and the spinner in focus with the game board and other players miniturized.
</p>
<p>
There is a logical flow in the aggregation of classes to the game board.<br>
By using an identifier for the different events and showing their classification was well done.<br>
The state and sequence diagrams are true to the order of play.
</p>
<p>
We the users accept the develpers decisions for the program.<br>
We believe that the Software design was written according to the needs of the user.
