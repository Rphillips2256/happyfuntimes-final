<h2 id="Preface">SRS Preface</h2>

<p>
We expect the SRS to be guidance for users and developers to make sure they know what the requirements are for developing the game. 
The user and developers will be able to look back and reference certain areas to make sure they are developing for the users needs.  
The user will also be able to look at this to make sure the developers are hitting the necessary step they said they would.  
If these steps arenâ€™t being made, people will be able to come and show what they expected and why they are or are not doing what expected.
The developers in the first stage have take a well thought out plan to decide what standards have to be met. 
Developers have also done some brain storming to see how each class is going to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
The SRS was updated and changed many times. The devlopers came together and brain stromed how we were going to handle specific about the 
programe.  We talked about the program and how it was going to be used by the users, and made changes as users want accordingly.
