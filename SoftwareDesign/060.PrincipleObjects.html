<h2 id="PrincipleObjects">Principle Objects</h2>
<p>
The principle objects of this system will include a(n):<br>
GAME class --<br>
This must be a singleton object and should contain methods to select the player count (limit of 6 as shown in the official rulebook), AI count (part of player count), select player identifiers, and player genders.<br>
Data members should include the essential elements of the game (i.e. money, stock, insurance, etc.) which will be passed to other objects for use when necessary.<br>
The game class must have two list-like data members: one for players, and one for spaces.<br>
This class must also have a spinner class.<br>
PLAYER class --<br>
This object should be created before the game starts with the relevant info that was given to the game class above.<br>
It should also contain methods that dictate pre-movement (i.e. buy insurance, buy stock, take loans, repay loans, etc.) and preparing to move (i.e. player-spins).<br>
Additional data members (to the ones passed by the game class) should include the players space-on-board, their career, house, insurances, stocks, LIFE tiles, and any outstanding loans.<br>
SPACE class --<br>
All spaces are associated with an event.<br>
To indicate which of the many events belongs to this space, there will be an event identifier.<br>
This could naturally be worked into a database design in the future.<br>
This class will also require a space-is-occupied boolean to indicate to other players whether or not to pass this space.<br>
Data structures that may also work well with this design are trees or hash maps.<br>
EVENT class –-<br>
This object is essential to the game.<br>
An event may be of multiple types (i.e. career, LIFE, draw, optional, add-people, payday, and stop), and so must contain a list of any identifiers in order to perform operations correctly.<br>
True to the original game, these events must be one of the four colors (i.e. orange, red, green, or blue), and have a description for clarity.<br>
SPINNER class --<br>
this is another singleton object that will be used in updating the players space on the board.<br>
Its data members will include an array of integers to be randomly cycled through, and the “speeding” career-space event.<br>
This class must include a player-spins method, and will take the player as a parameter and append their space-on-board number.<br>
Once a player spins their turn continues automatically unless prompted for intervention.<br>
LIFE TILE class --<br>
it is necessary for this to be its own object because it has at least three identifiable members: a monetary value, a description, and a player-assigned optional field.<br>
