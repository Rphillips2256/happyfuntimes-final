March 31: 
1st:Make sure the spinner class is working properly. We will make sure that the spinner itself generates number 1-9.  We will also make sure that
the game will give a result based on the number it generated.
2nd:We will also test to make sure that the results are places in the player class correctly.
3rd: We will test to make sure the spin class gives the order of the players and the players stay in that order throughout the game.
April 15:
1st:We will test to make sure that when the players are given a number the players will move to the correct spot.
2nd:We will also test to make sure that when the player has reached the end of the game the game ends.
3rd: We will test to make sure that the results are given.
April 21:
This is where we will have most of the code written. We will test to find if there is any other areas we need to improve on
