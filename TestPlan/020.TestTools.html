Describe the tools you plan to use when testing your software.

<p>
We will use JUnit as the test tool. JUnit is a unit testing framework designed for the Java programming language.<br>
JUnit is one of the good tool in the development of test-driven development frameworks,<br>
which known as the xUnit that originated with SUnit.<br>
JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time and can be used to write repeatable tests.<br><br>

We will also do manual testing by using system print output of the code we design.<br>
This tools will use to trest when build GUI after everything integrated.<br><br> 

We also as a group decided that a good way to test would be to set up schedule to hit when writing the program. Each individual will have a certain
section of code they will be writing. Each person will try to find ways to make their code crash and by doing this they will also be able to 
come up with a stronger and more efficient program.  We will write down the areas that we tested and how we were able to improve the code.  We will
also talk together as a group and decide if each section is strong enough to move on to the next section.
