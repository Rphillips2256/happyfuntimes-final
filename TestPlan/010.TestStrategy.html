<p>
1/. Unit testing for easy maintenance, better designs<br>
Unit tests are fast, grandular, and whitebox tests. 
They improve system design by incentivizing decoupling and simplicity. 
Unit test help most in maintenance of rapidly evolving code bases, 
where code contributions originate from different individuals at different subsystem.<br><br>

2/. Functional testing for component level behavior correctness<br>
Functional tests are mostly black box, and time consuming. 
They are used to ensure overall correctness of behavior, to better understand end user requirement etc. 
Because the functional tests are time consuming they are often triggered periodically, 
unlike the unit test suite which runs after every code change.<br><br>

3/. Integration testing for behavior correctness for the whole system<br>
Integration testing is essential. Integrations tests can effectively help test drive the whole migration process. 
In most cases, theyâ€™ll involve combining both operations and application code bases as a unified solution and testing the resultant system as a whole. 
These are the most time consuming tests, and generally key performance indicators are codified and asserted via integration test suites.<br><br>
