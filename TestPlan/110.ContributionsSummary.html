<h2 id="ContributionsSummary">Contributions Summary</h2>
<p> We as a group came together to figure out what areas needed to be tested to make the game the most efficient. 
Everyone contributed equally. Many ideas were given, and as a group we decided which ideas worked the best for our testing.<br>

We always meet after class to keep each other update and exchange ideas to improve project as a whole.<br>
Some time we email each other when some of us couldn't log in or lost connection from Bluemix.<br>
