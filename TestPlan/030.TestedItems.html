<p>
Describe the items you plan to test<br><br>

One very important things in this program is the spinner and the spin class.<br>
This is how many of the decisions are made in the program.<br>
We will make sure that the spin class is providing random number 1-9.<br> 
We will also make sure that when these numbers are chosen it picks the correct choice on the board.<br>
The player class is another area that we will test. <br>
We will make sure that the information is correct when player moves through the game.<br>
The player class holds all the Player information, without this class being accurate the whole game won't work.<br>
The gameboard will be tested to make sure if the player falls onto a certain space the correct questions is provided <br>
and the correct updates to the player is generated.<br><br>

we will test user input and try to add exception handling such as:<br>
1/. When we ask user to enter number of players, instead of enter number, user enter letter or symbols,<br>
the program will throw exception and redirect user to enter correct value.<br>
2/. Same as enter command from user, we will test the same as enter number of player by user.<br>
3/. Check validation if the result calculate is correct for each user of what they earn and pay loan or life crisis happen….<br>
How much balance left after each step of the game.<br>
