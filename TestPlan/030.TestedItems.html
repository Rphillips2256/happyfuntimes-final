One very important things in this program is the spinner and the spin class.  This is how many of the decisions are made in the program.  We will make sure
that the spin class is providing random number 1-10.  We will also make sure that when these numbers are chosen it picks the correct choice on the board.
The player class is another area that we will test.  We will make sure that the information is correct when player moves through the game.  The player class
holds all the Player information, without this class being accurate the whole game won't work.
The gameboard will be tested to make sure if the player falls onto a certain space the correct questions is provided and the correct updates to the player
is generated.
Each type of square will be tested to makes sure it is currectly excuctued. Example: green spaces will make sure the player is paid.

we will test user input and try to add exception handling such as:<br>
1/. When we ask user to enter number of players, instead of enter number, user enter letter or symbols,<br>
the program will throw exception and redirect user to enter correct value.<br>
2/. Same as enter command from user, we will test the same as enter number of player by user.<br>
3/. Check validation if the result calculate is correct for each user of what they earn and pay loan or life crisis happenâ€¦.<br>
How much balance left after each step of the game.<br>
