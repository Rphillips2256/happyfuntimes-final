Describe the items you plan to test

One very important things in this program is the spinner and the spin class.  This is how many of the decisions are made in the program.  We will make sure
that the spin class is providing random number 1-10.  We will also make sure that when these numbers are chosen it picks the correct choice on the board.
The player class is another area that we will test.  We will make sure that the information is correct when player moves through the game.  The player class
holds all the Player information, without this class being accurate the whole game won't work.
The gameboard will be tested to make sure if the player falls onto a certain space the correct questions is provided and the correct updates to the player
is generated.
Each type of square will be tested to makes sure it is currectly excuctued. Example: green spaces will make sure the player is paid.
