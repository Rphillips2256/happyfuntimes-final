<h2 id="Preface">SRS Preface</h2>
<p>This is the preface for the SRS.  The preface defines the expected usage of the document 
as well as information about versions of the SRS.  It should include a summary of the 
changes made in each version.
This should also include the list of the members of your team.</p>
<p>
We Expect the Srs to be guidance for users and developers to make sure they know what the requirements are for developing the game. 
People will be able to look back and reference certain areas to make sure they are developing for the users needs.  
The user will also be able to look at this to make sure the developers are hitting the necessary step they said they would.  
If these steps arenâ€™t being made people will be able to come and show what they expect and why they are or are not doing what is expected.
The developers in the first stage have take a well thought out plan to decide what standards have to be met. 
Developers have also done some brain stormy to see how each class is going to be implemented
