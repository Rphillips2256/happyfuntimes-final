<p>Our focus is to bring a virtual environment to the people playing this game. 
 We want them to feel as if they are there, just like in a real life situation, but at the same time keep the 
 enjoyment of the game. Risks, strategies and luck are needed to win the game.  
 Each player will be given a chance to spin a spinner and choose there fate.  You can either choose to go to college and 
 perhaps get a better paying job, but at the same time take a risk because you are forced into taking out a large loan 
 that can set you farther in debt, or choose to go to work and not make as much money.  Throughout the game you will have 
 to spin to advance, making you fall on spaces that will ask you to perform some action.  These actions can advance you in
 the game of life or set you back.  Once you are all the way through the board, you will be asked to show how much you are worth. 
 Your worth will be based on how much money you have, and how much you own.  The player with the most at the end of the
 game wins.
